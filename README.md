### Overview
_This project introduces you to common types of questions you’ll encounter during an in-person interview. Develop a healthier, more confident mindset around your qualifications as a candidate._

**Six questions** covering the topics learned and technical skills acquired in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program: Python, SQL, and machine learning.

### What was the biggest challenge?
Designing and implementing the `first_unique` function in question 4. The function, which returns the first non-repeated character in a string or None otherwise, required a bit of creativity and familiarity with Python string methods.

### Which part of the code do you like best?
The box of truffles algorithm in question 2. This computes the probability of drawing chocolate truffles with the desired filling, without replacement, and, if applicable, in a specific order. It also features my first Python class object.
